# *precision-medicine-toolbox* tutorials
The *precision-medicine-toolbox* functionality is illustrated in the following notebooks. 
You can clone the *precision-medicine-toolbox* repository to your computer and find the Jupyter files 
in the *examples* folder. The *data* folder is for imaging data. 
The scripts can be corrected accordingly.
## Imaging module
How to explore the imaging parameters, perform basic quality check for the imaging data, convert DICOM into NRRD, 
perform basic image pre-processing, check ROI segmentation, and extract the radiomic features:

## Features module
How to visualize features distribution in classes, 
plot the feature correlation matrix, 
check Mann-Whitney U-test p-values, plot univariate ROC 
(and calculate AUC) for each feature, perform volumetric analysis, 
and save all the scores:

* [tutorial features](features_module.md).
## Results module
How to get the formatted classification metrics with confidence intervals, 
plot confusion matrices and ROC curves: 

* [tutorial results](results_module.md).
